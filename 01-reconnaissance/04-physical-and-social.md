# Physical and Social Engineering Reconnaissance

Gathering intelligence through physical observation and social engineering techniques to understand target organizations and individuals.

## Overview

Physical and social engineering reconnaissance involves collecting information about target organizations through non-technical means. This includes gathering intelligence about physical locations, personnel, organizational structure, and security measures through observation and social interaction.

## Physical Reconnaissance

### Location Intelligence

| Information Type | Sources | Examples |
|------------------|---------|----------|
| **Satellite imagery** | Google Earth, Bing Maps | Building layouts, security perimeters |
| **Drone footage** | Aerial photography | Physical security measures |
| **Building layouts** | Public records, fire plans | Entry/exit points, restricted areas |
| **Street view** | Google Street View | Entrance security, cameras |

### Site Observation

| Target | Information Gathered | Security Relevance |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Entry points** | Doors, windows, loading docks | Physical access vectors |
| **Security cameras** | Camera positions, blind spots | Surveillance coverage |
| **Perimeter security** | Fences, barriers, sensors | Physical boundaries |
| **Personnel patterns** | Entry/exit times, routines | Social engineering opportunities |

### Dumpster Diving

| Document Type | Information Value | Risk to Organization |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Discarded paperwork** | Internal processes, contacts | Medium |
| **Hard drives/media** | Sensitive data | High |
| **Organization charts** | Personnel structure | Medium |
| **Meeting notes** | Project information | Low-Medium |

## Social Engineering Reconnaissance

### Personnel Information

| Data Point | Collection Methods | Usage |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Names** | LinkedIn, company websites | Target identification |
| **Job titles** | Social media, press releases | Authority assessment |
| **Phone numbers** | Company directories, OSINT | Direct contact |
| **Email addresses** | Public sources, pattern analysis | Phishing targets |

### Organizational Structure

| Information | Sources | Application |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Reporting relationships** | LinkedIn, org charts | Authority exploitation |
| **Department structure** | Company websites, job postings | Targeted approaches |
| **Key personnel** | Press releases, leadership pages | High-value targets |
| **Vendor relationships** | Public contracts, partnerships | Supply chain attacks |

### Social Media Intelligence

| Platform | Information Available | Collection Techniques |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **LinkedIn** | Professional relationships, job history | Profile enumeration |
| **Facebook** | Personal interests, family connections | Social graph analysis |
| **Twitter** | Real-time updates, opinions | Timeline analysis |
| **Instagram** | Location data, lifestyle information | Photo metadata |

## Information Collection Techniques

### Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

| Tool/Source | Purpose | Information Type |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Maltego** | Link analysis and visualization | Relationship mapping |
| **theHarvester** | Email and subdomain discovery | Contact information |
| **Shodan** | Internet-connected device discovery | Network infrastructure |
| **Pipl** | People search engine | Personal information |

### Social Engineering Methods

| Technique | Description | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Pretexting** | Creating false scenarios for information | Medium |
| **Baiting** | Offering something to trigger action | Medium |
| **Phishing** | Fraudulent communications | High |
| **Tailgating** | Following authorized personnel | Low |

### Badge and Access Card Intelligence

| Collection Method | Information Gained | Security Implications |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Photo analysis** | Badge design, security features | Cloning/forgery opportunities |
| **RFID scanning** | Card technology, frequency | Technical attack vectors |
| **Desk observation** | Badge placement, visibility | Physical theft opportunities |
| **Employee photography** | Badge wearing patterns | Social engineering tactics |

## Documentation and Evidence

### Photo Documentation

| Subject | Documentation Purpose | Legal Considerations |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Building exteriors** | Physical security assessment | Public photography rights |
| **Security measures** | Vulnerability identification | Avoid restricted areas |
| **Personnel** | Social engineering preparation | Privacy concerns |
| **Technology** | Technical intelligence | Intellectual property |

### Information Organization

```
Target: Example Corporation
Location: 123 Business St, City, State

Physical Security:
- Main entrance: Key card + security guard
- Loading dock: Unmonitored 6-8 AM
- Parking garage: Open access
- Cameras: 12 visible, blind spots noted

Personnel:
- John Smith (IT Director): LinkedIn profile, company car
- Jane Doe (HR Manager): Active on Twitter, posts schedule
- Security Guard (Bob): Friendly, talks about sports

Technology:
- Badge system: HID Prox cards
- Network: Corporate WiFi "CompanyName_Guest"
- Phones: Cisco VoIP system
```

## Social Engineering Attack Vectors

### Pretexting Scenarios

| Scenario | Target | Information Goal |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **IT Support** | End users | System access credentials |
| **Vendor Representative** | Procurement staff | Internal processes |
| **Researcher/Journalist** | Executives | Strategic information |
| **Delivery Person** | Reception | Physical access |

### Information Validation

| Technique | Purpose | Reliability |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Cross-referencing** | Verify information accuracy | High |
| **Multiple sources** | Confirm details | High |
| **Time correlation** | Ensure current relevance | Medium |
| **Direct observation** | Validate assumptions | Very High |

## Security Considerations

### Legal and Ethical Guidelines

- Always obtain proper authorization before conducting reconnaissance
- Respect privacy laws and regulations
- Avoid trespassing on private property
- Do not engage in activities that could cause harm or distress
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Operational Security

| Practice | Purpose | Implementation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Cover stories** | Plausible presence explanation | Pre-planned scenarios |
| **Document security** | Protect collected intelligence | Encrypted storage |
| **Attribution avoidance** | Prevent identification | Anonymous methods |
