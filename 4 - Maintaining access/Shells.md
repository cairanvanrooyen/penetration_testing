Three types:
Reverse Shell, Bind Shell, and Web Shell

|Type of Shell|Method of Communication|
|---|---|
|`Reverse Shell`|Connects back to our system and gives us control through a reverse connection.|
|`Bind Shell`|Waits for us to connect to it and gives us control once we do.|
|`Web Shell`|Communicates through a web server, accepts our commands through HTTP parameters, executes them, and prints back the output.|
